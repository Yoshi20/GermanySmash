<%= @tournament.name %>
===============================================

Hi <%= @user.username %>.

Because of too few registrations or other reasons, an administrator has cancelled the tournament "<%= @tournament.name.gsub('(cancelled) ', '') %>".

Date: <%= @tournament.date.to_s(:custom_datetime_with_weekday) %>

To join an other tournament, just follow the link:

We hope to see you soon in a different tournament.
