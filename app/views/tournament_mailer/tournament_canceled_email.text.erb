===============================================

Because of too few registrations or other reasons, an administrator has canceled the tournament "<%= @tournament.name.gsub('(canceled) ', '') %>".

Date: <%= @tournament.date.to_s(:custom_datetime_with_weekday) %>

To join an other tournament, just follow the link:
